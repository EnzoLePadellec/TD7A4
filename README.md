> ## TD 6 - Volumes, bind mounts & tmpfs mounts
Using Volumes and Bind Mounts:

## Part 1: Without using docker-compose

## Step 1:

Add to your application a feature, which reads a text file on your host and shows the content on a web page. Any changes in the content of this file should be shown by refreshing the web page. (by using a bind mount) 

The content of this file can for example explain the benefits of using docker volumes!

## Step 2:

Make your database persistent. (by using Volume)

Explain how you can migrate it! How to share it with another instance of the same database engine.

## Part 2: By using docker-compose 

Do both steps by using docker-compose and show your docker-compose.yaml and its changes!

Document your work and comment every command and step
